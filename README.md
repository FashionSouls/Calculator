# Calculator
This is a basic console program that will do basic arithmetic.

## How should the program work?
- Prompt user for two numbers
- Ask user what type of calculation they would like to do (plus, minus, division or multiplication)
- Output result
- Go back to the start

*How to get user input?*

The "Console.ReadLine()" will read the user's input.

```c#
Console.WriteLine("Enter your age:");
int age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("Your age is: " + age);
```
