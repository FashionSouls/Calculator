# Calculator
This is a basic console program that will do basic arithmetic.

## How should the program work?
- Prompt user for two numbers
- Ask user what type of calculation they would like to do (plus, minus, division or multiplication)
- Output result
- Go back to the start

**How do you get user input?**

The "Console.ReadLine()" function will return the user's input in the terminal.

*Example:*
```c#
Console.WriteLine("Enter your age:");
int age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("Your age is: " + age);
```
